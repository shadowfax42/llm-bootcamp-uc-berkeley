# 🤖 LLM Bootcamp – UC Berkeley (Spring 2023)

This repository documents my hands-on work from the **Full Stack Deep Learning (FSDL) LLM Bootcamp**, Spring 2023 edition, hosted at UC Berkeley. The bootcamp focused on rapidly prototyping, deploying, and managing LLM-powered applications with a full-stack mindset.


## 🧠 Bootcamp Overview

The curriculum is designed to walk participants through the full lifecycle of an LLM application—from ideation to deployment—with an emphasis on responsible and production-ready engineering.

### 📚 Core Sessions

- **[Launch an LLM App in One Hour](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/llm-bootcamp/spring-2023/launch-an-llm-app-in-one-hour/)**  
  Build and deploy your first LLM-powered app end-to-end using Python and serverless tools.

- **LLM Foundations**  
  An overview of modern LLM architecture, pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference best practices.

- **Prompt Engineering**  
  Techniques for reliable task specification: chain-of-thought, few-shot, self-reflection, etc.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
  Combine LLMs with external knowledge sources using vector databases and semantic search.

- **askFSDL Walkthrough**  
  A complete, production-grade RAG app integrating prompt engineering, embeddings, and UX.

- **UX for Language Interfaces**  
  Design principles for natural and intuitive LLM-powered applications.

- **LLMOps**  
  Testing, monitoring, versioning, and CI/CD for prompt- and model-level reliability.

- **What's Next?**  
  Discussion of agents, multi-modal LLMs, and future directions in language interfaces.

### 🧑‍🏫 Guest Talks

- **Reza Shabani** – *How to Train Your Own LLM*
- **Harrison Chase (LangChain)** – *Agents & Tool Use*
- **Peter Welinder (OpenAI)** – *Fireside Chat on LLMs & Product*


## 🛠️ What I plan to built

- ✅ An LLM-powered Q&A interface with RAG and vector search
- ✅ Prompt pipelines using self-critique and zero-shot CoT
- ✅ UX improvements for fallback/error handling in chat UIs
- ✅ LLMOps techniques for testing prompts and monitoring outputs
- ✅ A full-stack deployment using serverless tooling and embeddings
